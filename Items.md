<p>

| This backpack shares the uses of a bag of holding with the following alteration: The backpack bears a patch somewhere on its form. Any backpack of shared storage with the same patch accesses the same extra-dimensional space, and therefore items can be shared through the bag. However, creatures cannot be transported through the bags. This extra-dimensional space can be accessed on any plane of existence.
You can replace the patch on the backpack of shared storage with another patch to gain access to another extra-dimensional space. Placing more than one patch on the backpack of shared storage causes the bag, and all items in both extra-dimensional spaces, to be instantly destroyed. One can only regain any one item from the destruction by means of a Wish spell.*  -Thanks to "MagmaCake" on Reddit |
