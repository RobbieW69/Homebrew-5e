# Generic Info
**_This information is important make sure to read it_**

Side Note: This campaign takes place roughly 20 years AFTER the events of Karsus and the new Mystara becoming the goddess of magic. Also Dragonborn are direct children of Dragons in my campagin, but the enslavement still happened due to inferiority complexes, they just intermingled with each other. Dracno being the country that was teleported from Abeir. Also the reason for the magic plague was due to Karsus' Folly (If you don't know the references: https://youtu.be/SgS5_TAdbPc, https://youtu.be/fp_-5kXw_9g)    

Zandir:A beautiful continent. Northern mountains jutted with snow peaks, known as The Unshaken, glistening in the sun from the East. Southern volcano fires reach the sky. Western deserts hide Pyramids filled with gold. Eastern swamp waters fill the air with smog. Midland forests filled with beasts. Magic everywhere. 7 Kingdoms, -Roenheim, Sven, Frigdull, Junto, Thender, Dracno, Aisskyssa, Sleantkar.    

[Countries]
   
Roenheim:The most powerful kingdom, lies in the northern most forests, at the feet of the Unshaken. The king of Roenheim’s name is Bovenart(actual name is Dante Scirios), protected by a massive stone wall that completely surrounds the entire country, there is one huge entrance that is almost always open for travelers and farmers bringing goods. Every person is checked by Roenheim soldiers at the gate, there are archers on every rampart, which are spread roughly 100 feet apart from each other, guards constantly cycle 24/7. Bovenart is actually a vampire that is creating undead below the capital, Arendale, he’s also capturing werewolves from the surrounding forests trying to create a were-vampire hybrid. He also has magical items on him at all times, those of which help him be immune to the sun, make his skin tone darker, change his fangs to incisors. He has been the king for over 100 years, constantly changing his name and apparence claiming to be the son of the previous.He is HALF as powerful as the BBEG. AC 24, 5 legendary magic rings, a magic cape, and a belt of stone giant strength,Dex 20, Int 22, CR 20, HP 455. Dante and Ren have been trying for years now to tear down the magical barriers around Sven to go in and kill and steal all the magic items and wizards to keep as slaves, but the barriers have proven to be too strong, they are looking for a magic item of myths and legends that can break it open. But none of the patrols have come back successful, some have never come back from the dungeons said to hold the item.    

Thender:Southward toward the volcanoes, this country covered in soot and ash is home to the best blacksmiths in the world.The king of Thender sits on a throne in a castle below the biggest volcano, his name is King Ren(Arendale), the castle is made of stone mixed with ash, giving a dark look to the stonework, almost black. He has wizards down below creating magma rifts and creating an army of magma mephits and is trying to summon a demon of the nine hells, because he is possessed. The staff just think he's building this army to protect the kingdom.   
Deep beneath the ground  under the capital of Thender, soot and ash have soaked deep, combined with natural magic have caused Magma Mephits to spread away from the volcanoes and move throughout the ground below the capital, this is causing terrain to shift and cave in some places throughout.   

Frigdull:South of Roenheim, near the edge of  Thender, is a country of trade towns and farmers. The king of Frigdull, Harold, is a 40+ year old stout halfling man who is said to be the strongest in the realm (his Str is 30), a lawful good man who cares more about his people than himself, lives in a quaint little shack in the capital, a large wooden wall about 50 feet high and 4 layers thick surrounds the capital only, the surrounding towns of Frigdull have little to no defenses, small fences or just small town guard groups. He gives all that he can for the people, including lower taxes, he constantly goes around to the different towns asking the mayors what they think should be done to improve the city, he does this because he lost his wife and child years ago and wants to give all the help and love he can. He often will lift entire trees off of homes after tornadoes or horrible storms. His interactions with 2 of the other 7 Lords of the Realm, Bovenart and Ren have always been uncomfortable and uneasy, he has never liked them. Very weary. Being the farming capital of the realm, many other countries often make deals for specific goods unable to be attained anywhere else.   

Sven:The only Elven country, hidden by magic and nature, holds some of the oldest and wisest magic casters. Surrounded by extremely dense jungles, full of magical beasts of all kinds, but also an invisible barrier made with a 10th level spell over 400 years ago that cost the lives of 12 wizards,or so they think, this country has the most advanced technology in the Realm, mechanical items originated here but few have been smuggled to Aisskyssa in the last 20 years or so. The king of Sven, Corym, is about 30 years old, his grandfather was one of those to die for the barrier, he hates all other races and deems them inferior, however of all the elves he regards them as perfect beings. He has 3 magical items, 2 of which are legendary and one is an artifact. He will never age because of this.    
    
Junto:The floating country on the 7th Sea, lies giant sea monsters, merfolk, and ancient myths of magic tridents.The 7th Sea is the most dangerous, pirtates, marauders and many more dangers await here. However this a kind of “king”, though he never said so himself, many in and around Junto consider Roger to be the King, he’s a man who just loves freedom more than anything.    

Dracno:The only country of Dragonborns, other than here, Dragonborns are all but extinct.The king(leader) of Dracno, Daldric, is a red dragonborn, not born, but chosen to be the leader of all of them, with a heart of steel, fists hard as iron, was a main hero in the 12th Great War against the Old Ones back on Abeir. The capital of Dracno, Elbaph, is the largest city in the country and contains all of the libraries and most amazing warriors.   

Aisskyssa:Far to the west, in the heart of the desert lies this country, home to Rakshasa, Djinn, and  Pryamids filled with gold. Here lies a leader type of man, his name is Gunba, he's a sneaky and sly man who holds the most wealth in Aisskyssa.   

Sleantkar:Lying to the east, made up of swamps and jungles.Southwest of here lies the tombs and crypts of long dead magic casters and kings alike. Not many live in Sleantkar, most scout groups sent by other countries don’t come home. So for the most part they’ve stopped sending anyone there, it’s been declared an unsafe zone.   


Story:   

The year is 259ad.  

The Serene 7 is the meeting held once every 5 years by the leaders of all countries, the next one will be held in the year 260ad- roughly 8 months from now. They come together to discuss what the future of Zandir will look like, this would include things like Borders/Immigration, Laws of the Land, as well as problems such as Werewolf packs attacks, Cult groups appearing ect.    

Bovenart(Vampire) and Arendale(Human/Warlock) have finally amassed such large armies that this time around they will be declaring war against Frigdull and Dracno.  

Of course Harold and Daldric won’t just sit there and take it. Frigdull and Dracno will join forces. Corym usually doesn’t involve Sven in outside affairs however he notes that if a large battle ensues and Sven is put in danger, they will step in favor of Frigdull. Gunba won’t care since a battle so far away won’t put a damper on business at home. Roger probably won’t even show up to the meeting (1d100 < 80), if he does he will not care either since the war would be happening on the mainland.   

Roenheim and Thender would win against Dracno and Frigdull if no one else intervenes, meaning they would own the center of Zandir (except Sven), but then would have far more time and resources to try and break the barriers around Sven. What will happen?    

Corym is trying to get all of the best wizards in the country to get info on the evils in Zandir and possibly what the future of Sven looks like. Getting more wizards high enough level to try and make more barriers has been almost impossible, there’s about 4 wizards that are high enough level, but the ancient magic symbols and language required to use the spell has been lost over the centuries.   

In Sleantkar, many lizardfolk have become accustomed to humans not traveling in the swamps and marshes, so they are thriving, however, there seems to be about 10 lizardfolk going missing from almost every marsh that's inhabited by them every night. They can’t figure out who or what is doing this, but when they get to the end of the trail of blood and tracks they end up at a giant cemetery with a huge mausoleum in the middle where they can hear the screams of ungodly creatures and the smell of the undead doesn’t let them get closer.   

#### Changes
* Long Rest= At minimum: 8 hours of rest or more. 

* Short Rest= 2 hours of doing nothing, napping, meditating, non combat/intensive or stressful work. (Ex: Walking on a road, going to the bathroom, reading a book)

* Potions= Item Interaction. (skin touch dont have to drink, meaning throwable)
(Consider: Quick action/Storage)

* Rolling for HP: You can roll or average or roll a d20(dc 18) to take max. This is both for the beginning and for leveling. Always reroll 1's.

* Rolling for Abilities: You can roll 3 sets, 
choose the best set you want.

* I reward hard work. Role play your heart out, grind out materials to invent an item? Yes. I love those kinds of players. DM's inspiration is different for me.

* Falling- After first 10ft = 1d6dmg- (if player wants)Dex or Str for ea 10ft..

* Sprint= 2x speed, outside of combat only.

* System Shock? DC 15 Con or Wis save. This when you take more than half your health in damage, irl would be known as going into Shock. This can be fixed by receiving medical aid within 1 minute of taking the damage, however you are left prone clutching the wound and unable to move.

* Ability modifiers= Extra Proficiencies of that Ability (max 2).

* Calling shots (ie; "I aim for the neck") will have me use my own + or - depending on the situation instead of just disadvantage or advantage. (That doesn't mean they can't be applied also) i.e. The Ranger 300 feet away from the bbeg who is fully covered in plate armor, is calling "I aim for the eye slit", okay thats a -10 to your roll and their AC doesn't change. 

* Always Racial Feats.(Currently adding racial feats for as many races as I can)

* Bows become Finesse weapons(using Strength or Dex for + to hit/damage)

* Anyone that can use magic, can use Spell Scrolls.(spell casters can use the scroll to gain an additional higher level cast if they know the spell or regain a spell slot of that spells level, also you can study a spell scroll, then practice the spell, once you’re good enough with it you can add it to spells you know)

* If you are proficient in a skill: Crit fails in that skill will  be +Prof, Crit successes will be extreme.

* Don't roll for heals. Max heal.
Semi-Hit Points(Optional, not sure if I want to implement this yet, ex: You sprain your leg and spend one week at half movement)

* Spell Points(Optional, This is an entire rework for spellcasters, I really like the idea of magic being a pool you can use from instead of set into slots, however this would be very confusing to newer players and I would really have to have everyone's okay and delve deep into it myself, I would have to rework warlocks, sorcerers, and other subclasses)

* Allowed Races: All official content. (including UA unless I deem it too broken, just ask)

* If you want to add a very specific homebrew thing or unofficial content added, ask me before hand and we can have a one on one about it.
