# My Rules
* This homebrew is a mix and mash up of different spells, items, feats and other mechanics that come from my own imagination, Pathfinder, Earlier versions of DnD,and other materials, so be warned this game will play differently than normal 5e.

* This is 5e based, however I will say that not everything is boiled down to advantage/disadvantage, at my discretion + and - to hit or miss will be decided on how hard or easy a task is, and I will try to be realistic with it. EX: If you're flying and invisible, for the enemy to shoot you in the sky will be a -10 to their roll since it would be extremely hard to hit a flying invisible target or a -15 if the sun is directly in their eyes, simple disadvantage doesn't do the justice of showing how hard some feats can be.

* All rolling has to be done in front of me. Either on Discord or Foundry with cam on Idrc, I just need to see the roll with my own eyes.

* If you want secrets from the party, that's fine, but as the DM I have to know what you want to do so I know what all needs rolled, also if you do something out of character, I'll ask for the reason, I mean just explain what the reason is, as long as it makes sense we're good!

* Do remember the DM has the final say so, if an arguement starts about something and the DM says to stop, that will be the end of it.
