#Generic Info
Just some generic info to be aware of that you won't find in a source book.
####Changes
* Long Rest= At minimum: 8 hours of rest or more. 

* Short Rest= 2 hours of doing nothing, napping, meditating, non combat/intensive or stressful work. (Ex: Walking on a road, going to the bathroom, reading a book)

* Potions= Item Interaction. (skin touch dont have to drink, meaning throwable)
(Consider: Quick action/Storage)

* Rolling for HP: You can roll or average or roll a d20(dc 18) to take max. This is both for the beginning and for leveling. Always reroll 1's.

* Rolling for Abilities: You can roll 3 sets, 
choose the best set you want.

* I reward hard work. Role play your heart out, grind out materials to invent an item? Yes. I love those kinds of players. DM's inspiration is different for me.

* Falling- After first 10ft = 1d6dmg- (if player wants)Dex or Str for ea 10ft..

* Sprint= 2x speed, outside of combat only.

* System Shock? DC 15 Con or Wis save. This when you take more than half your health in damage, irl would be known as going into Shock. This can be fixed by receiving medical aid within 1 minute of taking the damage, however you are left prone clutching the wound and unable to move.

* Ability modifiers= Extra Proficiencies of that Ability (max 2).

* Calling shots (ie; "I aim for the neck") will have me use my own + or - depending on the situation instead of just disadvantage or advantage. (That doesn't mean they can't be applied also) i.e. The Ranger 300 feet away from the bbeg who is fully covered in plate armor, is calling "I aim for the eye slit", okay thats a -10 to your roll and their AC doesn't change. 

* Always Racial Feats.(Currently adding racial feats for as many races as I can)

* Bows become Finesse weapons(using Strength or Dex for + to hit/damage)

* Anyone that can use magic, can use Spell Scrolls.(spell casters can use the scroll to gain an additional higher level cast if they know the spell or regain a spell slot of that spells level, also you can study a spell scroll, then practice the spell, once youâ€™re good enough with it you can add it to spells you know)

* If you are proficient in a skill: Crit fails in that skill will  be +Prof, Crit successes will be extreme.

* Don't roll for heals. Max heal.
Semi-Hit Points(Optional, not sure if I want to implement this yet, ex: You sprain your leg and spend one week at half movement)

* Spell Points(Optional, This is an entire rework for spellcasters, I really like the idea of magic being a pool you can use from instead of set into slots, however this would be very confusing to newer players and I would really have to have everyone's okay and delve deep into it myself, I would have to rework warlocks, sorcerers, and other subclasses)

* Allowed Races: All official content. (including UA unless I deem it too broken, just ask)

* If you want to add a very specific homebrew thing or unofficial content added, ask me before hand and we can have a one on one about it.
